1. Purpose

Configure the NSIMD library; see

From the web site:

Agenium Scale vectorization library

NSIMD is a vectorization library that abstracts SIMD programming. It
was designed to exploit the maximum power of processors at a low
development cost.

To achieve maximum performance, NSIMD mainly relies on the inline
optimization pass of the compiler. Therefore using any mainstream
compiler such as GCC, Clang, MSVC, XL C/C++, ICC and others with NSIMD
will give you a zero-cost SIMD abstraction library.
